Hello Git and GitHub
Trying to add new data to the readme file in Git and GitHub. 
I am working on understanding how to use git for version control.
Adding yet another line and wondernig if i can make it work. 

This is somewhat intersting to be able to track changes and push them to a remote repository so data and versioning is not lost if my computer dies
